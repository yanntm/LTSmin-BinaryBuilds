<p>
This page hosts binaries used in our tool chains, and built from LTSmin, from the FMT group based in Twente, NL : 
<ul>
<li>LTSmin (see <a href="http://fmt.cs.utwente.nl/tools/ltsmin/">LTSmin homepage</a>)</li>
</ul>
These artifacts are not very portable, they're used in our build system, so are specific to the versions (gcc, glibc...) that live on travis-ci (Linux, OSX targets) or AppVeyor (Windows target).
The build is configured to only build what we depend upon, we don't aim to build all of LTsmin in this build.

Please see the sources of this project to see exactly how we build them on Travis and AppVeyor.
